### Description

The purpose of this code is to remotely administer an MTS COM/COM+ packages from any platform (windows 9x, Win2000, etc . . .) that supports DCOM. It contains the ability to add/remove packages and components, administer packages security, change package and component properties and most other routine operations required to administer an MTS machine. It does this by using a server side DLL and client side application, eliminating issues that arrise with the differences between COM+ and NT4.0 MTS. Please note that roles cannot be administered with this version.

Update #1--Fixed bug in client that didn't properly map the filename to a UNC when adding a new component. Also fixed a bug that occured when multiple computers had the same components installed resulting in duplicate keys in the treeview.
